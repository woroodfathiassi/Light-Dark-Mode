        <h1>Dark and Light Mode</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our website! Here, you can switch between dark and light modes to enhance your viewing experience.

          <ul>
            <li><a href="#tabs-1">Eye Comfort</a></li>
            <li><a href="#tabs-2">Battery Life</a></li>

          <div id="tabs-1">
            <p>In light mode, the website uses a bright background with dark text, which can be ideal for well-lit environments. This mode is often preferred during daytime use as it mimics the appearance of traditional printed text on paper.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dark mode offers a darker background with light text, reducing the amount of blue light emitted by screens. This setting is beneficial for reducing eye strain and improving comfort during nighttime browsing or in low-light conditions.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>Light mode, while providing clear visibility, can consume more power on OLED and AMOLED screens since these types of displays require more energy to produce lighter colors. This can lead to quicker battery drain on mobile devices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dark mode can help conserve battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, as these displays use less power to show darker colors. By opting for dark mode, users can extend their device's battery life, especially during prolonged usage.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>The clean and bright appearance of light mode is often associated with a professional and minimalist design. It is widely used in various applications and websites, providing a familiar and straightforward user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dark mode provides a modern and stylish look that many users find visually appealing. It can give websites and applications a sleek, contemporary feel, making the content stand out while also offering a unique browsing experience.</p>
